# Power-Bi-
Excited to share my latest Power BI project focusing on population visualization! 
In this project, I've leveraged Power BI's robust capabilities to analyze demographic trends and visualize population data in an insightful way.
In this project I use raw data of different country to show population 2030 to 2040.
